## 🧙 Method Overview
We present **DisPose** to mine more generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input, which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence.

## 🔧 Preparations
### Setup repository and conda environment
The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.0.1` and `torchvision>=0.15.2`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. The demo has been tested on CUDA version of 12.4.
```
conda create -n dispose python==3.10
conda activate dispose
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare model weights
1. Download the weights of  [DisPose](https://huggingface.co/lihxxx/DisPose) and put `DisPose.pth` into `./pretrained_weights/`.

2. Download the weights of other components and put them into `./pretrained_weights/`:
  - [stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1/tree/main)
  - [stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main)
  - [dwpose](https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/tree/main)
  - [MimicMotion](https://huggingface.co/tencent/MimicMotion/tree/main)
3. Downlaod the weights of [CMP](https://huggingface.co/MyNiuuu/MOFA-Video-Hybrid/resolve/main/models/cmp/experiments/semiauto_annot/resnet50_vip%2Bmpii_liteflow/checkpoints/ckpt_iter_42000.pth.tar) and put it into `./mimicmotion/modules/cmp/experiments/semiauto_annot/resnet50_vip+mpii_liteflow/checkpoints`

Finally, these weights should be organized in `./pretrained_weights/`. as follows:


```
./pretrained_weights/
|-- MimicMotion_1-1.pth
|-- DisPose.pth
|-- dwpose
|   |-- dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx
|   └── yolox_l.onnx
|-- stable-diffusion-v1-5
|-- stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1
```

## 💫 Inference

A sample configuration for testing is provided as `test.yaml`. You can also easily modify the various configurations according to your needs.

```
bash scripts/test.sh 
```

### Tips
- If your GPU memory is limited, try set `decode_chunk_size` in `test.yaml` to 1.
- If you want to enhance the quality of the generated video, you could try some post-processing such as face swapping ([insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)) and frame interpolation ([IFRNet](https://github.com/ltkong218/IFRNet)).
